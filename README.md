- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShriyanshSupakar
- I'm interested in roblox scripting and scripting for games in it/
- That is what i'm currently learning
- It's only been a month or so since I started scripting, still I am not able to do some simple scripts like making a cuff system similar to border roleplay cuffs. Would love it if someone would collaborate with me and be a sor t of scripting partner while clearing my doubs. I currently can't find a good source to learn lua so please help me out.
- My discord is NickPlayz#2592. Just send a request and i'll accept it, we can talk there.
